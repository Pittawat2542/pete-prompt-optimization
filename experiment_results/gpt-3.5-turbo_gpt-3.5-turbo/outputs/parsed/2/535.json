  "reason": "The message acknowledges that there is no proximity chat or in-game text chat in Fortnite, which suggests that the toxicity level in the game is low. It also compares Fortnite to League of Legends, stating that League of Legends is 100x more toxic generally. This comparison further supports the argument that Fortnite is not toxic.",
