  "message": "My sens is irrelevant to you, do what's comfortable for you. Copying other people's sens won't make you good at the game, we have different length arms and grips and different resistance mousepads / mouse feet - some mouse sensors are even different.",
  "reason": "The message promotes a positive and supportive attitude by encouraging the recipient to do what is comfortable for them. It emphasizes that copying other people's sensitivity settings won't necessarily make someone good at the game due to individual differences such as arm length, grip style, and mousepad/mouse feet resistance. The message also acknowledges that even mouse sensors can vary. Overall, the message does not contain any toxic or offensive language and promotes understanding and individuality.",
