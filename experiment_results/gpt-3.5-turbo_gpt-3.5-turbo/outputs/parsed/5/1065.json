  "reason": "The message contains negative language and self-deprecating remarks, but it does not contain any explicit toxic or offensive content. The use of 'suck' and 'smfh' (shaking my head in frustration) may indicate frustration or dissatisfaction, but it does not cross the line into toxic behavior. Therefore, the message can be classified as 'clean'.",
