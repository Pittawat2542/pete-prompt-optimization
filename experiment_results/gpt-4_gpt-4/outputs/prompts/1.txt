In this task, you need to analyze the given "Message" from a conversation in an online community and predict whether it is "toxic" or "clean". 

"Toxic" refers to any messages that contains offensive, rude or disrespectful language. "Clean", on the other hand, refers to messages free from such attributes.

The result must be provided in the JSON format in a Markdown block (between ```json and ```) and must include the actual "message", the "reason" for your classification and the "predicted" category. 

Message: <message>

Here is the required format for your output:
```json
{
"message": "<the actual message>",
"reason": "<explanation for your prediction>",
"predicted": "<predicted category - either 'toxic' or 'clean'>"
}
```
You will have to replace the placeholder text within "<>" with actual data. Here's how you can approach this:

If the message contains offensive language, your output may look like this:
```json
{
"message": "You are stupid",
"reason": "The message has offensive language directed towards someone.",
"predicted": "toxic"
}
```
If the message is polite and respectful, your output may look like this:
```json
{
"message": "Good job on winning the game!",
"reason": "The message has no offensive language and is congratulating someone.",
"predicted": "clean"
}
```
Thus, you need to read, analyze and categorize the given message appropriately.
