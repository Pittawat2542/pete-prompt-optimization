  "message": "Hey Ham. sorry for spam but you took a toiletbreak,quick question. Do you know how PUBG gives you teammates in squad and duo if you are playing without friends? It seems like i always get the new players when i try to team up. You know if they choose players by hidden rank or is it just random? The question was not as quick tho.. Haha, GG's! Have a great stream, as always hambLove",
