      "reason": "The message is classified as 'clean'. The reason for this classification is that the user is questioning why people say that Fortnite is toxic and providing evidence to support their argument. They mention that Fortnite does not have proximity chat or in-game text chat, which are common features in online games that can contribute to toxic behavior. Additionally, they compare Fortnite to League of Legends, stating that League of Legends is 100x more toxic generally. This comparison suggests that the user believes Fortnite is not as toxic as other popular online games, further supporting the 'clean' classification.",
