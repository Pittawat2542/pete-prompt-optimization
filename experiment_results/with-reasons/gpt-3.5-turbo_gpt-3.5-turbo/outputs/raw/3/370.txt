```json
{
"message": "like holy shit make it stop",
"reason": "toxic",
"predicted": "toxic"
}
```

The message "like holy shit make it stop" contains profanity ("holy shit") and expresses frustration or annoyance ("make it stop"). These elements indicate a toxic tone, which is why I classified it as toxic.
