```json
{
"message": "Jesus, it's a warzone in that city monkaS",
"reason": "Toxic",
"predicted": "toxic"
}
```

The message is classified as "toxic" because it contains an expression of shock or disbelief ("Jesus") and describes the situation in a negative and intense manner ("it's a warzone"). The use of the emote "monkaS" also adds to the overall negative tone of the message.
