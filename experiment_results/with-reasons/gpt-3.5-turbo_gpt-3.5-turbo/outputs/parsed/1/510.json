  "message": "BTW. I'm going to keep streaming, because I genuinely like it. Expect them all to be super late though because that's legit the ONLY time I am able to stream.\n\nI am only streaming League of Legends because that's all I care to play these days.\n\nHope you enjoyed my dose of reality",
  "reason": "The message does not contain any offensive or harmful language. It simply states the person's intention to continue streaming because they genuinely enjoy it. The mention of streaming late and playing only League of Legends does not contribute to toxicity. The closing statement of 'Hope you enjoyed my dose of reality' can be interpreted as a bit sarcastic, but it does not make the message toxic overall.",
