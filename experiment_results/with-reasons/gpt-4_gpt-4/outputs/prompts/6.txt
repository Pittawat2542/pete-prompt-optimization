In this task, your objective is to analyze a "Message" extracted from an online community conversation and predict its nature, categorizing it either as "toxic" or "clean". 

A "toxic" message encapsulates any content that employs offensive, disrespectful, or rude language. Conversely, a "clean" message ensures that it lacks any such destructive elements, appearing respectful and considerate effectively. 

Evaluate the message deliberately and base your prediction on the presence or absence of any offensive or disrespectful content. 

The prediction needs to be cast in the JSON format encapsulated in a Markdown block (between ```json and ```) consisting of the "message" in its original form, the "reason" advocating your classification decision, and the "predicted" category. 

Delivery of Message: <message>

Here's the compulsory format corresponding to your output:
```json
{
"message": "<Original message>",
"reason": "<Justification on your prediction>",
"predicted": "<Predicted category - 'toxic' or 'clean'>"
}
```
Replace the text within the angle brackets "<>" with the appropriate content. Here are a few illustrations on interpreting this:

In case the message encapsulates offensive language, the output may appear as follows:
```json
{
"message": "You are dull",
"reason": "The message consists of derogatory language, aimed to offend someone.",
"predicted": "toxic"
}
```
If the message looks polite, respectful, and without any offensive content, the output may appear like this:
```json
{
"message": "Congratulations on acing the test!",
"reason": "The message doesn't contain any offensive language, and is applauding someone's achievement.",
"predicted": "clean"
}
```
Consequently, you need to scrutinize, evaluate, and categorize the delivered message appropriately, providing a thorough justification for your predictions.
