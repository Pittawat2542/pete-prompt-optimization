In this task, your job is to examine a provided "Message", which is an extracted component of a conversation from an online community platform. Your task is to accurately predict and classify it as "toxic" or "clean". 

"Toxic" as used in this context refers to messages comprising language that is offensive, rude, disrespectful or contains a level of animosity. On the contrary, "Clean" refers to messages that are devoid of offensive or disrespectful language. They are typically polite and respectful.

Your prediction result must adhere to the JSON format within a Markdown block (enclosed by ```json and ```). The result format should comprise the "message" verbatim, the "reason" detailing your justification for the classification, and the "predicted" category showing your final prediction. 

Message: <message>

Here is the standardized format for your output:
```json
{
"message": "<replace with actual message>",
"reason": "<replace with your reasoning>",
"predicted": "<replace with your prediction - either 'toxic' or 'clean'>"
}
```
You're required to replace the placeholder text within the "<>" with appropriate data with respect to the task. Consider the following examples:

Example 1:
If the message entails offensive language, your output could be analogous to this:
```json
{
"message": "You are worthless",
"reason": "The message contains derogatory language directed towards an individual.",
"predicted": "toxic"
}
```
Example 2:
If the message embodies respect and demonstrates a polite tone, your output could resemble the following:
```json
{
"message": "Congratulations on your promotion!",
"reason": "The message lacks offensive language and celebrates a person's achievement.",
"predicted": "clean"
}
```
You're expected to critically examine, interpret, and classify the provided message with sound judgment.
