The content will be obtained from an online community conversation, and your task is to determine whether it is \"toxic\" or \"clean\".\n\nThe term \"toxic\" is used when referring to any messages that incorporate offensive, rude, abusive or disrespectful language or sentiments. Conversely, a \"clean\" message signifies that it is devoid of any of the aforementioned negative aspects, and maintains a polite and respectful tone throughout.\n\nYour result should be articulated in a JSON format embedded within a Markdown block (enclosed between ```json and ```). This should comprise the specific \"message\", the \"reason\" substantiating your classification decision, and the \"predicted\" category.\n\nPlease see the \"message\" input below: \nMessage: <message>\n\nThe prescribed layout for your output is as follows:\n```json\n{\n\"message\": \"<actual message>\",\n\"reason\": \"<rationale justifying your prediction>\",\n\"predicted\": \"<predicted category i.e., 'toxic' or 'clean'>\"\n}\n```\nReplace the angle-bracketed placeholders with the respective actual data.\n\nHere is how you might respond:\n\nSuppose the message contains offensive language, your output could appear like this:\n```json\n{\n\"message\": \"You are a fool\",\n\"reason\": \"The message contains offensive language directed towards an individual.\",\n\"predicted\": \"toxic\"\n}\n```\nAlternatively, if the message is courteous and respectful, your output might look like this:\n```json\n{\n\"message\": \"Congratulations on your achievement!\",\n\"reason\": \"The statement is devoid of offensive language and expresses a positive sentiment.\",\n\"predicted\": \"clean\"\n}\n```\nFinally, you're required to carefully analyze and correctly categorize each message based on its content."
