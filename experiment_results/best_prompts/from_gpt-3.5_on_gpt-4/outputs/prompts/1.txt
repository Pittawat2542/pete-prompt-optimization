Please classify the provided "Message" taken from an online community interaction to one of the two categories, namely, "toxic" or "clean". Your classification should depend on the tone and content of the message, with "toxic" being assigned to messages that contain harmful or offensive content, and "clean" for messages that are respectful and in alignment with community guidelines. 

For each classification, also provide a "reason". This should be a brief explanation revealing the factors that influenced your decision. 

Please refer to the "Prediction result" section provided above for more insight into the application of these categories. This may highlight examples of previous classifications or trends in the model's predictions.

Finally, present your answers in the form of a JSON format inside a Markdown code block (between `json` and `code`).

Message:  <message>

Output format:
```json
{
"message": <message>,
"reason": <reason>,
"predicted": <predicted category>
}
```
Remember:

1. Under no circumstances can you alter the content of the "Message" and "predicted category".
2. The "reason" should be a justification based on some aspects of the message text, potentially supplemented with observations from the "Prediction result" section.
3. When in doubt, refer to other "Prediction result" examples to better understand how to interpret the categories and justify your predictions accurately.
