Your classification should depend on the tone and content of the message, with \"toxic\" being assigned to messages that contain harmful or offensive content, and \"clean\" for messages that are respectful and in alignment with community guidelines. \n\nFor each classification, also provide a \"reason\". This should be a brief explanation revealing the factors that influenced your decision. \n\nPlease refer to the \"Prediction result\" section provided above for more insight into the application of these categories. This may highlight examples of previous classifications or trends in the model's predictions.\n\nFinally, present your answers in the form of a JSON format inside a Markdown code block (between `json` and `code`).\n\nMessage:  <message>\n\nOutput format:\n```json\n{\n\"message\": <message>,\n\"reason\": <reason>,\n\"predicted\": <predicted category>\n}\n```\nRemember:\n\n1. Under no circumstances can you alter the content of the \"Message\" and \"predicted category\".\n2.

When in doubt, refer to other \"Prediction result\" examples to better understand how to interpret the categories and justify your predictions accurately."
