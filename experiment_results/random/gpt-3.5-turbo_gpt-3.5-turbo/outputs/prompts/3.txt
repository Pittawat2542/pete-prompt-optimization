Classify the following text message from a chat in an online community into one of the specified categories: "toxic" or "clean". Provide a reason for the classification in the specified JSON format, placing the response within a Markdown code block (between ```json and ```).

Make sure to follow these guidelines:
1. Replace `<message>` in the prompt with the actual text message to be classified.
2. In the JSON output, replace `message` with the actual text message.
3. In the JSON output, replace `reason` with an explanation for the classification.
4. In the JSON output, replace `predicted category` with either "toxic" or "clean" based on the classification.

JSON Output Format:
```json
{
  "message": "Actual text message",
  "reason": "Explanation for the classification",
  "predicted": "toxic or clean"
}
```

Example:
Given the following text message:
```
Classify the following text as either toxic or clean.

Message: Hey, I really enjoyed reading your article. It was very informative and well-written. Keep up the great work!
```

The correct classification with reasoning would be:
```json
{
  "message": "Hey, I really enjoyed reading your article. It was very informative and well-written. Keep up the great work!",
  "reason": "The message expresses a positive sentiment, complimenting the article and encouraging the author.",
  "predicted": "clean"
}
```
