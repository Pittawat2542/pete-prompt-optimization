"message": "Thatâ€™s pretty pathetic. I stick with the One X I think. First time in my 30+ years of gaming that I havenâ€™t been excited for a next gen console.",
"reason": "The message contains a negative remark ('That's pretty pathetic') which could be interpreted as offensive or disrespectful. However, it seems to be directed towards a situation or object (possibly a gaming console), not a person. Therefore, it's not necessarily toxic, but it's not entirely clean either.",
"predicted": "clean"
