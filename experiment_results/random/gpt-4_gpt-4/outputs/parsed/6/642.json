{
  "message": "Sooooo if u say u have a GF ur actually lying so 5head",
  "reason": "The message implies that the recipient is lying about having a girlfriend, which can be seen as a form of accusation or insult. However, it does not contain explicit offensive language, derogatory comments, prejudiced language, or profanity. The term '5head' is often used in online communities to denote someone as smart or clever, usually in a sarcastic manner. This could be seen as a mild form of incivility, but it's not strong enough to categorize the message as 'toxic'.",
