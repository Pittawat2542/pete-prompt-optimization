Please evaluate the presented "Message", which originates from an interchange on an online chat forum, and classify it as either "Toxic" or "Clean". 

For clarity, here are some guidelines: 

- A "Toxic" message is one that includes obscenities, defamatory remarks, offensive/discriminatory language, or any forms of inappropriate content. This extends to threats, harassment, and bullying. 

- A "Clean" message does not include any form of inappropriate content. It is polite, respectful, and does not involve any forms of hate speech or harmful intent.  

Furthermore, provide the rationale behind your classification. This should include the elements or keywords you considered while classifying the message as either "toxic" or "clean".

Message for Classification: <message>

Your output should be displayed in a JSON format, enclosed within a Markdown code block (starting with ```json and concluding with ```). Hereâ€™s what each segment of the JSON structure represents:

- "message": Denotes the message undergoing classification. 
- "reason": References the analytical procedure or consideration factors that guided your classification as either "toxic" or "clean". 
- "predicted": Denotes the assigned classification for the message. This should only be either "toxic" or "clean".

The following JSON structure should be adhered to:

```json
{
"message": "<insert the exact message that needs to be classified here>",
"reason": "<explain the reason behind your determined classification here>",
"predicted": "<fill in the predicted classification: 'toxic' or 'clean'>"
}
```

For example, if you are analyzing the message "You are such a loser!", the correctly formatted JSON output should look like: 

```json
{
"message": "You are such a loser!",
"reason": "The message contains a demeaning remark that is disparaging, offensive, and could be perceived as a form of bullying. Therefore, it's defined as a 'toxic' message.",
"predicted": "toxic"
}
```
