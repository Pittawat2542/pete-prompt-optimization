Please classify the given "Message" pulled from an online chat community conversation into one of two categories: "toxic" or "clean". A text is considered "toxic" if it contains offensive, rude, or inappropriate content; it is classified as "clean" if it does not contain any such content. Please specify a reason for your classification.

Message to classify: <message>

Provide the output in the following JSON format in a Markdown code block (the block should open with ```json and close with ```):

- "message" refers to the actual message you classified.
- "reason" refers to your analysis or justification for assigning the "toxic" or "clean" category to the message.
- "predicted" refers to the category you predict for the message, which should be either "toxic" or "clean".

Here's the JSON structure to adhere to:

```json
{
"message": "<the actual message goes here>",
"reason": "<your reason for choosing the category>",
"predicted": "<predicted category: 'toxic' or 'clean'>"
}
```

For example, for the message "You're a loser!" the JSON formatted output should look like this:

```json
{
"message": "You're a loser!",
"reason": "The message contains an offensive term directed at an individual, categorised as toxic.",
"predicted": "toxic"
}
```
