Please analyze the supplied "Message", which is retrieved from a conversation on a digital communication platform, and classify it as either "toxic" or "clean". A "toxic" message contains obscenities, slanderous remarks, offensive or prejudiced language, or other forms of inappropriate content. A "clean" message, inversely, does not feature any of such content. It's crucial to furnish the reason underpinning your categorization.

Upon classifying the message text, please utilize the subsequent JSON format as presented inside a Markdown code block (initiated with ```json and terminated with ```). The elements of the JSON structure can be understood as follows: 

- "message": This symbolizes the text of the message thatâ€™s being classified.
- "reason": It portrays the analysis or factors considered during the process that led to your conclusion of the message being either "toxic" or "clean".
- "predicted": This signifies the assigned category to the message after evaluation, expected to be either "toxic" or "clean".

Ensure adherence to the below JSON pattern: 

```json
{
"message": "<insert the exact message here>",
"reason": "<describe reason for determining its category>",
"predicted": "<predicted category: 'toxic' or 'clean'>"
}
```

Assume for a moment that you're classifying the message "You're a loser!", the corresponding JSON output might appear like this: 

```json
{
"message": "You're a loser!",
"reason": "The message consists of a derogatory statement aimed at an individual, which is considered offensive, leading to a 'toxic' classification.",
"predicted": "toxic"
}
```
